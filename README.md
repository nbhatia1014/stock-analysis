# Analyzing Two Years of Stock Returns:

## Overview of Project:

### Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to utilize the tools of the Developer tab within Excel to create a powerful VBA Macro that could analyze twelve individual stocks for Steve. With this Macro, we are able to analyze the returns and the daily volume for 12 various stocks within two years very quickly and easily.

## Results and Analysis:

### 2017 Overview:

Shown above is a summary of the results of the Macro run on the stocks in 2017. As shown above, the stocks had a very successful year in 2017. All but one stock had postive return for the year. Shown in the chart below is how long it took to run the process for 2017. It took only 0.0703 seconds to run the process.

## Summary:

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactored Code:
A few of the advantages to refactoring code is the ability to restructure the source code without altering the functionality. In addition, it makes the code less clunky and less repetitive. This may allow for better testing when the code is being peer reviewed. It could also allow the code to be scaled if done properly.

While the code may be cleaner and easier to scale, this increases the likely hood that the code could have bugs. If the bugs are not addressed appropriately, the software and code will not be able to scale and it will be more difficult to figure out. Since the cleaner code will not increase the functionality, this could create more problems than benefit.

### Comparison between the Original and Refactored Code:
